<section class="about-text">
  <p>
    I'm a passionate amateur student who loves building projects, sharing
    knowledge and contributing to the Open Source Community. I enjoy the art of
    learning and then using it in my day to day life.
  </p>

  <p>
    My skills are most proficient in Developing & Deploying Apps and Websites
    with Flutter, React, Node & Flask , but I consider working with these as a
    side hassel. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things.
    And even though I am not very strong at it, I would love to work on ML
    related projects more. But more than that my interests are in building.
    Something that would benefit everyone equally.
